## Introduction

The Shopping Cart project is a React-based web application designed to provide users with a seamless shopping experience. Users can browse through different products, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout. The application includes features like dynamic categorization, quantity management, and a responsive design for various screen sizes.

## Features

1. **Dynamic Categorization:**
   - Explore products based on different categories, making it easy to find what you're looking for.

2. **Quantity Management:**
   - Easily adjust the quantity of each product in the cart, with options to increase, decrease, or remove items.

3. **Responsive Design:**
   - The application is designed to ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience across different devices.

## Technologies Used

The Shopping Cart project utilizes the following technologies:

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router:** A library for navigation within a React application.
- **Hooks:** Used for state and side-effect management.
- **PropTypes:** Used for documenting component props.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the link
 
```
https://github.com/MrSaadMasood/the-odin-project-2023.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to explore the shopping cart.
6. Run the project without strict mode if you want to check the the overall project. But the Cart wont work correctly with the strict mode as the cart is rendered two times in strict mode. So the values appear to be doubled.    

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure, with components such as `ProductCard`, `Catagories`, `Platforms`, `TopGames`, `ProductList`, and `CartBar` etc. organized for clarity and maintainability.
